h1. Carnatic Scores Repository 

bq. ..._International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)_ believes that music should be something that is easily accessible for everyone. For this purpose we have created a music library to provide music scores free of charge to anyone with internet access... "imslp.org":http://imslp.org/

Well, there are no such libraries that make Carnatic music notations/scores available to anyone in need, until now. 

This repository aims to create beautiful Carnatic music scores that anyone can download and even modify to suit their purpose.

As of now, there is a small collection of finely crafted scores ready for download.
