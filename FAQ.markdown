###  What do we have here?

Scores (Notations) for Carnatic music compositions. 

### FREE?

Yes. Anybody can download/print/share for personal, non-commercial use.

### Who are you?

I am Ananth. I compose music.  You can listen to my music and find out more about me at [Beautifulnote.com](http://beautifulnote.com/blog) 

### Why are you making FREE notations?

Mostly for my own personal use. Most of these compositions are over 100 years old. Yet, there are a very few scores that can be freely shared by learners and enthusiasts. So I offer my work under creative commons so anyone can use and share - for personal use. 

### Your scores look neat. We want to publish them. How do we contact you?
