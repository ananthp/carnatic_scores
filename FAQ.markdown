##  What do we have here?

Notations for Carnatic music compositions. 

## FREE?

Yes. Anybody can download/print/share for personal, non-commercial use.

## Who are you?

I am Ananth. I compose music.

## Why are you making FREE notations?

Mostly for my own personal use. Most of these compositions are over 100 years old. Yet there are a very few scores that can be freely shared by learners and enthusiasts. So I offer my work under creative commons so anyone can use and share - for personal use. 

## Your scores look neat. We want to publish them. How do we contact you?
